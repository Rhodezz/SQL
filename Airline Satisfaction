GROUP BY `Customer Type`;
First-time	0.2399
Returning	0.4781
Thoughts: People who are returning are much more satisfied at 47% while new customers are 23% satisfied. 
5.	Does the type of travel, Personal or Business, dictate satisfaction in one way or the other? 
-	SELECT
-	    `Type of Travel`,
-	    AVG(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Average_Satisfaction
-	FROM flight_info.airline_passenger_satisfaction
-	GROUP BY `Type of Travel`;
Business	0.5837
Personal	0.1013
Thoughts: People who travel for business are 58% satisfied while Personal travel is only 10%. This could be a good point for visualization. 
6.	Does the class have any indication of satisfaction?
-	SELECT
-	    Class,
-	    AVG(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Average_Satisfaction
-	FROM flight_info.airline_passenger_satisfaction
-	GROUP BY class;
Business	0.6945
Economy	0.1876
Economy Plus	0.2463
Thoughts: Business class is much more satisfied at 69% while economy plus is 24% and Economy is 18%. This could be a good point to show visilization.
7.	Does the length of the flight decrease satisfaction in a logical consistent manner? 
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN `Flight Distance` BETWEEN 1 AND 1000 THEN '1-1000'
        WHEN `Flight Distance` BETWEEN 1001 AND 2000 THEN '1001-2000'
        WHEN `Flight Distance` BETWEEN 2001 AND 3000 THEN '2001-3000'
        WHEN `Flight Distance` BETWEEN 3001 AND 4000 THEN '3001-4000'
		WHEN `Flight Distance` BETWEEN 4001 AND 5000 THEN '4001-5000'
    END AS Distance_Range,
    AVG(`Flight Distance`) AS Average_Distance,
    AVG(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Average_Satisfaction
FROM flight_info.airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY Distance_Range
ORDER BY distance_range;
1-1000	499.9004	0.3306
1001-2000	1436.3216	0.4612
2001-3000	2459.9004	0.6499
3001-4000	3505.7314	0.7750
4001-5000	4660.8205	0.5513
Thoughts: Interestingly the shortest distance traveler customers are some of the least satisfied. I wonder if this has something to do with more people go shorter distance for personal use since personal travel customers were much more dissatisfied. It does seem like there is a sweet spot for customer as 3000-4000 miles worth of travel.
8.	How does gate location play a role in satisfaction?
SELECT 
    AVG(`Gate Location`) AS AVG_satisfaction_from_gate_location,
AVG(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Average_Satisfaction
FROM `flight_info`.`airline_passenger_satisfaction`
group by `Gate Location`
order by `Gate Location`
0.0000	1.0000
1.0000	0.4986
2.0000	0.4645
3.0000	0.3470
4.0000	0.3907
5.0000	0.5679
Thoughts: From the query I canâ€™t see any correlation showing that the gate location has anything to do with satisfaction. 
9.	Does high rated baggage handling correlate to higher customer satisfaction?
SELECT 
    AVG(`Baggage Handling`) AS Baggage_ratings,
AVG(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Average_Satisfaction
FROM `flight_info`.`airline_passenger_satisfaction`
group by `Baggage Handling`
order by `Baggage Handling`
# Baggage_ratings, Average_Satisfaction
'1.0000', '0.3002'
'2.0000', '0.2945'
'3.0000', '0.2378'
'4.0000', '0.4807'
'5.0000', '0.6160'
Thoughts: from this I can see that if the satisfaction is a 5 for baggage handling, then the satisfaction rating goes up substantially almost 61% of the time. 
10.	Do customers that rate the online booking high also rate other categories high?
SELECT 
    AVG(`Ease of Online Booking`) AS Baggage_ratings,
AVG(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Average_Satisfaction
FROM `flight_info`.`airline_passenger_satisfaction`
group by `Ease of Online Booking`
order by `Ease of Online Booking`
# Baggage_ratings, Average_Satisfaction
'0.0000', '0.6661'
'1.0000', '0.3795'
'2.0000', '0.3037'
'3.0000', '0.3100'
'4.0000', '0.5317'
'5.0000', '0.7346'
Thoughts: from this Query I can see that ease of Online booking has a massive impact on satisfaction. A 5 rating is almost 73% satisfied and gradually decreases. 

11.	Attributes that effect satisfaction the most. 
Combined seat comfort leg room service has a massive effect on satisfaction. 
SELECT
    ((`Seat Comfort` + `Leg Room Service`) / 2) AS Combined_Comfort_Legroom,
    AVG(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Average_Satisfied
FROM flight_info.airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY Combined_Comfort_Legroom
ORDER BY Combined_Comfort_Legroom;
'0.5000', '0.3077'
'1.0000', '0.1183'
'1.5000', '0.1417'

'2.5000', '0.2154'

from flight_info.airline_passenger_satisfaction
